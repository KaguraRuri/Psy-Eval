But the exact timeline of disorder development or transition from subclinical to the clinical state is usually clear and conclusive. However, preventive measures are hardly ever discussed in the context of mental health.", "C": "Unlike other medical disorders, preventive measures in psychiatry involve extensive patient education and counselling sessions.

Therefore, the diagnosis of mental disorders is heavily influenced by the assessors’ theoretical perspectives and subjectivity. Moreover, mental illnesses can still be considered despite an individual not fulfilling the proper diagnostic criteria led down in classificatory systems, but there is detectable dysfunction. Furthermore, the precise timing of disorder initiation or transition from subclinical to clinical condition is often uncertain and inconclusive.
